Use Shorthand

ie
'w 100 food' means spend 100$ on food (if food is not an existing account)
'W 25 Bob' means got $25 from Bob
'amex 12.32 clothes' means spent $12.32 from AMEX on clothes
'checking 32.12 wallet' means transfered 32.12 from checking account to wallet
etc etc
general syntax: '<debit> <amount> <credit>' (ie "I spent from wallet 12.32 on food")

start with w and W

Transaction
-credit_id
-debit_id
--if these are 0, then we use the custom_party field

Account
user_id - who this account belongs to
name - what this account name is
debit_shorthand - what the shorthand is for spending (unique from name, credit_shorthand)
--longhand = "debit_name", "d_name", "dname", ie if i have an account named "Wallet", i can do "debit_wallet $10"
credit_shorthand - what the shorthand is for crediting (unique from debit_shorthand; CAN be same as name)
--longhand = "credit_name" (same as debit_); can also just use Name
